CURRENT APPROACH:
Let T = a set of agents selected as the current mission team.
Let S = the mission is sabotaged.
P(S | T) = sum of the probabilities that each player on the team is a spy divided by size of team:
    - P(S | T) = Î£ over all a on team of P(spy(a))/len(T)

* Not using the vote outcome at all to update spy probabilities
* init all spy prpbabilities - for all agents - to 0.5
* These probabilities are never getting updated from 0.5


maintain a table of possible worlds were a world is a particular configuration of spies, e.g if players = {a, b, c, d, e}
then there are 2 spies. Each possible world is then {(a, b), (a, c), (a, d), (a, e), (b, c), (b, d), (b, e), (c, d), (c, e), (d, e)}
P(W) = 1/number of worlds initially

If a and c go on a mission and the mission was sabotaged, increment P(a and c are spies | the mission was sabotaged by 1 player) by the bayesian update

assume spies betray with probability 0.8

(a, c) go on mission and mission fails with 1 betrayal -> a or c is a spy
