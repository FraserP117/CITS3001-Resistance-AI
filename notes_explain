second table 

players = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2 spies

assume P(spy will betray) = 0.8

a world is a particular configuration of spies.

all possible worlds = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}

Observation: 3 and 4 go on a mission and the mission is sabotaged by 1 vote. 

It looks like each row is a possible world and each column is a player who went on the current mission. 
Table enteries are then populated by entering P(spy will betray) if the player in the current column is in the corresponding possible world. 
It looks like the probability that each world exists is then merely the sum of all values in the row corresponding to each world. I know you explained this to me yesterday, but I am unable to accout for the 0.32 in the secondlast row by using this method.
