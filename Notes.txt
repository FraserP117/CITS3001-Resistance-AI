CITS3001 - Notes on the Project 

Project requires you to research, implement and validate and Artificial Inteligence for the Card Game: "The Resistance".

The game is a bluffing game for 5-10 players.

Players are randomly assigned into one of two teams: "Government spies" or "resistance fighters". 

All spies know who the other spies are but resistence members have no 
informatuon about any team meberships.

A game consists of 5 rounds.
Each round, a leader proposes a mission to the resistence team.
If a majority of the players vote to go on the mission, the mission proceeds, otherwise a new mission leader is appointed.

If a spy is n the mission, they can make the mission fail.
Players are not informed of who made the mission fail, but are informed on how many missions failed.

If a majrity of missions succed, the resistence wins otherwise the spies win.

This game provides many A.I challenges:
	* Uncertainty:
		resistance do not know roles of all players 
	*  

To Discuss with Liam:

Relevant parts of the textbook:
Chapter 12: Acting under uncertainty
Chapter 13: Probabilistic reasoning 
Chapter 14: Probabilistic reasoning over time 
Chapter 17: Making Complex decisions
Chapter 18: Multi-Agent Decision Making 
Chapter: 20: Learning Probabilistic Models 
Chapter 22: Reinforcement Learning

Potential Avenues From the Paper

My RL model for trading stocks?

Look at the comming lectures on Baysean Method
Opponent Modelling techniques (Section 3.6), as is discussed in Section 3.

send Liam the 3rd edition of the AI book!
